            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>In 2004, a permanent kiosk opened in the park: Food Network was born. This modern day “Food Network”
                serves up the most delicious healthy foods. An
                instant neighborhood fixture, Shake Shack welcomed people from all over the city, country and world who
                gathered together to enjoy fresh, simple, high-quality versions of the classics in a majestic setting.
                The rest, as they say, is Food Food Network.
